# The Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams

See: https://www.scrum.org/resources/kanban-guide-scrum-teams

Kanban (n): a strategy for optimizing the flow of value through a process that uses a visual, work-in-progress limited pull system.

Central to the definition of Kanban is the concept of flow. Flow is the movement of value throughout the product development system. Kanban optimizes flow by improving the overall efficiency, effectiveness, and predictability of a process.

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Key to empirical process control is the frequency of the transparency, inspection, and adaptation cycle - which we can also describe as the cycle time through the feedback loop.

The four basic metrics of flow that Scrum Teams using Kanban need to track are as follows:

*   **Work in Progress (WIP):** The number of work items started but not finished. Note the difference between the WIP metric and the policies a Scrum Team uses to limit WIP. The team can use the WIP metric to provide transparency about their progress towards reducing their WIP and improving their flow.
*   **Cycle Time/Lead time**: The amount of elapsed time between when a work item starts and when a work item finishes.
*   **Work Item Age:** The amount of time between when a work item started and the current time. This applies only to items that are still in progress.
*   **Throughput:** The number of work items finished per unit of time.

Littles Law - The Key to Governing Flow:

**Average cycle time = average work in progress / average throughput**

> "The average number of work items in a stable system is equal to their average completion rate, multiplied by their average time in the system." - John Little, 1961

The average completion rate can be represented by either throughput, or its inverse, average cycle time.

Scrum Teams can achieve flow optimization by using the following four practices:

1.   
    *   **Visualization of the workflow**
    *   **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)**
    *   **Active management of work items in progress**
    *   **Inspecting and adapting the team’s definition of “Workflow”**

The four Kanban practices are enabled by the Scrum Team’s definition of “Workflow” and are as follows:

1.  Visualize the workflow (Kanban board)
    1.  Defined points at which the Scrum Team considers work to have started and to have finished.
    2.  A definition of the work items – the individual units of value (stakeholder value, knowledge value, process improvement value) that are flowing through the Scrum Team’s system (most likely Product Backlog Items (PBIs)).
    3.  A definition of the workflow states that the work items flow through from start to finish (of which there must be at least one active state).
    4.  Explicit policies about how work flows through each state (which may include items from a Scrum Team’s definition of “Done” and pull policies between stages).
    5.  Policies for limiting Work in Progress (WIP).
2.  Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)
    1.  The primary effect of limiting WIP is that it creates a pull system. It is called a pull system because the team starts work (i.e. pulls) on an item only when clear that it has the capacity to do so. When the WIP drops below the defined limit, that is the signal to start new work. Note this is different from a push system, which demands that work starts on an item whenever it is requested. Limiting WIP helps flow and improves the Scrum Team's self-organization, focus, commitment, and collaboration.
3.  Active management of work items in progress
    1.  Making sure that work items are only pulled into the workflow at about the same rate that they leave the workflow.
    2.  Ensuring work items aren’t left to age unnecessarily.
    3.  Responding quickly to blocked or queued work items as well as those that are exceeding the team’s expected cycle time level (See Service Level Expectation – SLE).
        1.  The SLE itself has two parts: a period of elapsed days and a probability associated with that period (e.g., 85% of work items should be finished in eight days or less). The SLE should be based on the Scrum Team's historical cycle time, and once calculated, the Scrum Team should make it transparent.
4.  Inspecting and adapting the team’s definition of “Workflow”
    1.  The Scrum Team uses the existing Scrum events to inspect and adapt its definition of "Workflow”, thereby helping to improve empiricism and optimizing the value the Scrum Team delivers. The following are aspects of the Definition of “Workflow” the Scrum Team might adopt:
        1.  Visualization policies – for example, workflow states – either changing the actual workflow or bringing more transparency to an area in which the team wants to inspect and adapt.
        2.  How-we-work policies – these can directly address an impediment. For example, adjusting WIP limits and SLEs, changing the batch size or how often items are pulled between states can have a dramatic impact.

**Flow-Based Events**

1.  The Sprint
    1.  Even in environments where continuous flow is desired/achieved, the Sprint is still a cadence or a regular heartbeat for inspection and adaptation of both product and process.
2.  Sprint Planning
    1.  A flow-based Sprint Planning meeting uses flow metrics as an aid for developing the Sprint Backlog.
3.  Daily Scrum
    1.  What work items are blocked and what can the Development Team do to get them unblocked?
    2.  What work is flowing slower than expected? What is the Work Item Age of each item in progress? What work items have violated or are about to violate their SLE and what can the Scrum Team do to get that work completed?
    3.  Are there any factors that may impact the Scrum Team’s ability to complete work today that are not represented on the board?
    4.  Have we learned anything new that might change what the Scrum Team has planned to work on next?
    5.  Have we broken our WIP limit? And what can we do to ensure we can complete the work in progress?
4.  Sprint Review
    1.  Inspecting Kanban flow metrics as part of the review can create opportunities for new conversations about monitoring progress towards a goal. Reviewing Throughput can provide additional information when the Product Owner discusses likely delivery dates.
5.  Sprint Retrospective
    1.  A flow-based Sprint Retrospective adds the inspection of flow metrics and analytics to help determine what improvements the Scrum Team can make to its processes. The Scrum Team using Kanban also inspects and adapts the definition of “Workflow” to optimize the flow in the next Sprint. Using a cumulative flow diagram to visualize a Scrum Team’s WIP, average approximate Cycle Time and average Throughput can be valuable.
6.  Increment
    1.  Scrum’s empiricism encourages the creation of multiple releasable increments during the Sprint to enable fast inspect and adapt feedback loops. Kanban helps manage the flow of these feedback loops more explicitly and allows the Scrum Team to identify bottlenecks, constraints, and impediments for faster, more continuous delivery of value.

**Endnote**

Scrum is not a process or technique. It is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. As _The Scrum Guide_ points out, it functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices. Kanban's hyperfocus on transparency, visualization, and flow maximizes feedback, empiricism, and ultimately the delivery of value.

## Study Notes from practice tests:

**Kanban**

A strategy for optimizing the flow of stakeholder value through a process that uses a visual, WIP limited, pull system.

P.S. You have to have a board and WIP limits to be Kanban as well

**Practices**

ONLY the following are Kanban practices:

Limit WIP  
Visualize flow  
Actively manage WIP  
Inspect and adapt the workflow

**Optionals'**

When Scrum is used with Kanban, none of the fundamental elements of Scrum (i.e., roles, events, and artifacts) are removed; this process only adds new practices and processes to the existing Scrum framework.

Needless to say, any non-Kanban element that is optional in Scrum (e.g., user stories, story points, planning poker, and burn-down charts) stays optional in Scrum + Kanban.

**Little's Law**

Based on Little's Law, the following formula is true in a stable system:  
Average Cycle Time = Average Work in Progress / Average Throughput

Based on Little's Law, there's a relationship among WIP, Throughput, and Cycle Time. Throughput and Cycle Time are lagging indicators and WIP is a leading indicator. Remember that Little's Law can be used to calculate one of the metrics based on the other two, for historical data, BUT it should not be used to forecast the future.

Here are the definitions for these equations’ parameters:

Lead time: The time between the initiation and delivery of a work item.  
Cycle time: The time between two successive deliveries  
Throughput: The rate at which items are passing through the system.  
WIP: The number of work items in the system. Work that has been started, but not yet completed

This is the main theorem in the Queuing Theory, which is also known as Little’s Law (It was described by John Little in 1961):  
The average number of work items in a stable system is equal to their average completion rate, multiplied by their average time in the system.

On lead-time vs cycle time: https://kanbantool.com/kanban-cycle-time-vs-lead-time

**Element Inspection Event**

The most important elements inspected in each Scrum event are:

1.  Sprint Planning: Throughput
2.  Daily Scrum: Work Item Age, WIP, WIP Limit, CFD
3.  Sprint Review: Cycle Time, Throughput
4.  Sprint Retrospective: WIP Limits, Cycle Time, Throughput, SLEs, CFD, scatterplot

**The Four Flow Metrics**

1.  Throughput
2.  Cycle Time
3.  Work In Progress
4.  Work Item Age

**Work Item Ageing**

While in some cases observing old age across multiple items in a certain area of the workflow can help identify bottlenecks, the main role of the Work Item Age metric is to identify specific items that are struggling and require attention. Bottlenecks/systemic constraints are typically identified by looking at the queues on the board as well as charts like the Cumulative Flow Diagram.

**Throughput**

When planning a sprint our main interest is to figure out how many backlog items to pull into the Sprint. The throughput of previous Sprints is the most useful in figuring this out. An advanced technique would be to use Monte Carlo simulation using this throughput data in order to figure out confidence-levels for various amounts of items in the Sprint Backlog.

**Definition of Workflow**

A defined workflow must include the following:

1.  Starting point
2.  Finished point
3.  At least one active state
4.  Pull policies
5.  Definition of individual units of value
6.  Every Scrum must create one

**Feedback Loops**

Both cycle time and work item age are feedback loops.

*   Work item age: This gives daily feedback on the age of an item. This is very important during Daily Scrum!
*   Cycle Time: This gives feedback on how long it took to finish an item/average items.

Work Item Age is a leading indicator for the length of the Scrum Team’s feedback loop for that (in progress) item. If an item is aging quite a bit it is certainly an indication that it’s cycle time will be high. Cycle time throughout the team’s definition of Workflow can also be considered the length of the team’s feedback loop.

[Leading vs Lagging Indicators](https://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2018/11/08/leading-and-lagging-indicators-right-way-measure-performance/#:~:text=A%20leading%20indicator%20is%20a,only%20record%20what%20has%20happened.)

Cycle time is a lagging indicator for the length of the Scrum Team’s feedback loop for a product backlog item. You only know the cycle time after the PBI reached the end of the team’s definition of Workflow. You can only measure cycle time by looking at historical data. It is an indicator and point of reference but should be used carefully when predicting the future. A Service Level Expectation (SLE) is based on cycle time scatter plot percentile lines.

"A lagging indicator without a leading indicator means that you lack clarity on how an outcome will be achieved and miss early warnings on whether or not you are moving towards your strategic goal. Likewise, a leading indicator without a lagging indicator means you lack confirmation on whether or not you are indeed achieving your end goal."

In a Scrum context: https://www.leadingagile.com/2018/02/leading-lagging-indicators/

Leading indicators are:

*   Work in Progress (WIP)
*   Work Item Age

Lagging indicators are:

*   Cycle Time
*   Throughput
*   Velocity (not a flow indicator, though)

**WIP Limit**

The following are most likely to happen when WIP is limited because of shorter average Cycle Time:

1.  Faster value generation
2.  More sustainable pace

According to Little's Law, reducing the average WIP is correlated with shorter average Cycle Time in a stable system (everything else being the same). A shorter Cycle Time has many advantages such as shorter feedback loops, more predictability, and less waste.

Because limiting WIP "seems" to prevent us from utilizing 100% of our capacity, some people think that it's less productive, which is not true.

Remember that WIP Limit creates a pull system, which has its advantages. The way Kanban visualizes Workflows, which is based on determining states of work (columns on a Kanban board) causes some people to think that it's based on silos and reduces collaboration. This is not the case, though, because the pull system of Kanban forces people to work together on bottlenecks and improve the whole process, rather than being focused on one of the states. As a result, a true Kanban system can even increase collaboration.

Finally, some people think that because the WIP Limit is a limit, it's against self-organization. This is not so, because the team members themselves are the ones who decide to use Kanban and set the limits accordingly.

No one is allowed to increase the Sprint WIP Limits in response to emerging urgent work. Having urgent work is not a reason for increasing the WIP Limit; you either expedite the work (exceed the WIP Limit) or wait until you have free capacity.

**Throughput vs Velocity**

Throughput is the number of items that exit a Workflow, or a state of Workflow, in a unit of time; e.g., 20 user stories per Sprint.

Remember that Throughput is about the number of items, in contrast to velocity, which is about the size of items finished in a unit of time (e.g., 150 story points per Sprint).

**Tasks vs Value limit**

In a flow-based system, the number of tasks is not necessarily limited, rather the amount of value-generating work items is limited.

**SLE: Team Service Level Expectation**

SLE CAN be used in Sprint Planning to provide PO and stakeholders with an idea towards the service level that can be expected from the team. That doesn’t include providing a specific date for each PBI in the SBL. The SLE enables the Development Team to forecast a finished date at a certain confidence level once the item has been started.

Must contain:

1.  A period (range of durations)
2.  A probability

An SLE is a simple expectation/goal (not a promise or a consequential commitment) about Cycle Times. Because of uncertainties, it's presented with one or more pairs of probability (e.g., 85%) and range (e.g., up to 7 days). If different types of work are defined in the Workflow, there can be different SLEs for those types. Remember that it is not a commitment, it is an expectation/forecast.

Q. Why is SLE realistic?  
A. An SLE is realistic because it is based on historical data, the team met these expectations in the past. Although not every item will meet the completion time, an SLE is more than a completion time alone, it also includes a probability.

Q. Why is SLE reliable?  
A. Example SLE: 80% of the work items of this type are done in 5 days.

In the example, we see that our team completed these types of tasks 80% of the time in 5 days or less. The SLE is mainly used as an inspection and adaptation of the flow by the development team. When a work item is reaching its SLE or has passed its SLE could be a trigger for the team to act upon.

Note that an SLE is not reliable for commitment dates, it is not meant to be used like that.

One thing to note though is that an SLE improves over time because it has more historical data.

**Sprint Backlog**

The old-fashioned approach in Agile projects was to keep the Sprint Backlog frozen, in order to create a stable environment and increase productivity; after all, Sprints are not that long. However, this approach hasn't seemed flexible enough in recent years, and many resources, including Scrum.org, believe that you can add or remove items in the Sprint Backlog when needed (which raises the question of why there should be a Sprint Backlog to begin with, but that's a different problem).

So, it is acceptable to add and remove work items according to Scrum.org. However, that doesn't mean you can make any changes you want:

1.  Changes should be compatible with the Sprint Goal, and
2.  You should be able to deliver something potentially releasable by the end of the Sprint if you make those changes.

**Kanban and Scrum**

The Scrum values are:

Focus  
Openness  
Courage  
Commitment  
Respect

Scrum elements (roles, events, and artifacts) do _change_ when used with Kanban:  
None of the Scrum elements (roles, events, and artifacts) are removed when it's used with Kanban; however, that doesn't mean that there's no change at all, otherwise, it would mean that Kanban and Scrum work in isolation. For example, Daily Scrums may change a little because developers now have access to interesting information such as Work Item Age. However, Daily Scrums won't change by not being timeboxed anymore.

**Expedites**

When something really urgent occurs, for example, a production bug it is better to add it as an exception rather than changing the WIP Limits. WIP Limits are used to optimise flow. If you would change WIP Limits due to an urgent production bug the team might miss the chance to improve their flow.

1.  Kanban: Is your sprint a swamp or a river
2.  Only included the 4 main Kanban points because they compliment what a scrum team is already doing. Scrum teams already have a collaborative inspect-and-adapt experimentation process together with a set of explicit feedback loops they’re using. Advanced concepts not part of the guide because we don’t consider them part of the “Minimally viable set of practices” a Scrum team should focus on when trying to improve their flow.
3.  Advanced Kanban concepts include:
    1.  Classes of service
    2.  Cost of delay
    3.  Flow efficiency
4.  "I’ve helped Scrum teams achieve an even healthier smoother flow by adding Kanban to their process. I’ve helped Kanban teams accelerate their pace of improvement by adding cadence/rhythm and clarity."

[What Scrum Gets Wrong About Kanban and What Kanban Gets Wrong About Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/what-scrum-gets-wrong-about-kanban-and-what-kanban-gets-wrong-about-scrum)

1.  One is not better than the other.
2.  MYTH: Scrum is revolutionary; Kanban is evolutionary.
    1.  The concept of limiting work in progress is revolutionary in most organizations.
3.  MYTH: Scrum is for X and Kanban is for X (or Kanban is all about manufacturing)
    1.  Although Kanban derived many of its lean concepts from the manufacturing sector, they apply equally as well to complex knowledge work.
4.  MYTH: Kanban doesn't encourage teamwork
    1.  What they are missing is Kanban’s key practice of actively managing flow by the team. Combine actively managing flow with the practice of improving collaboratively, and you naturally end up with cross-functional, self-organizing teams of people working together to deliver value. WIP limits encourages individuals to swarm.
5.  MYTH: Scrum’s Sprint Planning Event is a time waste
    1.  The intent of the Sprint Planning meeting isn’t to create a detailed Sprint plan, but to instead come together as a team to decide what goal to achieve and to come up with a plan to complete that goal.
6.  MYTH: Sprints Constrain Flow
    1.  "The second misunderstanding is that a Development Team can only work on items specified in Sprint Planning. Nothing in the Scrum Guide stops a team from embarking on new work mid-Sprint as long as it meets two conditions. The first is that the work doesn’t endanger the Sprint Goal. The Development Team is still committed to its delivery. The second is that the team will have a potentially releasable product Increment for the Sprint Review. This means that either the new work will be “Done” by the end of the Sprint or that working on it won’t restrict the team from having a potentially releasable Increment at the end of that Sprint."

[A Kanban Primer for Scrum Teams](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/kanban-primer-scrum-teams)

1.  Kanban core principals:
    1.  Start with what you do now
    2.  Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
    3.  Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities, and titles
2.  Original core Kanban practices before they striped down for scrum:
    1.  Visualize (the work, workflow, and risks to flow/value delivery)
        1.  "Visualizing the flow throughout the value stream means we should mainly visualize the flow of Product Backlog items (PBIs) rather than tasks."
    2.  Limit WIP (Work in Process)
        1.  "WIP limits should be low enough that they introduce pain-- meaning that they push you beyond what you’re comfortable with and used to. You want to channel this pain towards ways of improving the team’s process and policies so that in the future, the flow will be better and the WIP limit will be less painful."
    3.  Manage Flow
        1.  _..TO BE CONTINUE.._
    4.  Make Process Explicit
    5.  Implement Feedback Loops
    6.  Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally (using models and the scientific method)

[Scrum and Kanban Stronger Together](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-and-kanban-stronger-together)

1.  Because Kanban and Scrum practitioners have broken into separate camps, software teams are missing out on practices that would improve their effectiveness.

[4 Key Flow Metrics and how to use them in Scrum's events](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/4-key-flow-metrics-and-how-use-them-scrums-events)

These are the 4 key flow metrics that Scrum teams can use to improve their flow:

1.  WIP
    1.  Note the difference between WIP and the WIP Limit. The WIP Limit is a policy that the Scrum Team uses as a "constraint" to help them shape the flow of work. The goal of the WIP Limit is to reduce the amount of actual work in process (WIP). The team can use the WIP metric to provide transparency into their progress towards reducing their WIP and improving their flow.
    2.  Tool/Report: Cumulative Flow Diagram
2.  Cycle Time
    1.  This metric is a lagging indicator of flow. It is available only after an item is actually finished from the workflow perspective (e.g. reached a Done lane on the Kanban board). It is typically used to drive improvement work as well as to be able to establish internal/external expectations as to the team's turnaround time on specific items.
    2.  Tool/Report: Cycle Time Scatterplot
3.  Throughput
    1.  Note the measurement of throughput is the exact count of work items, without any compensation for item size - which is a major difference between throughput and story-points based velocity.
    2.  Tool/Report: Throughput run chart
4.  Work Item Age
    1.  Work Item Age complements Cycle Time. If Cycle Time is a lagging indicator only relevant for finished items, Work Item Age is a leading indicator only relevant for non-finished items. The basic idea is to provide transparency to which items are flowing well and which are sort of "stuck" even if not formally blocked.
    2.  Look at the overall age but combine it with where the work currently is in the workflow as well as what the teams SLE. Combining all this information can help the team focus on the items that are at the most risk of missing the team's expectations/SLE.
    3.  Example:
        1.  Let's say a team has an SLE of 16 days with 85% confidence. If one of the cards on their board has an age of 10 days, is that ok? is it a problem? The answer is that it depends. If that card is very close to the end of the workflow it is probably not a problem. If it is very close to the start of the workflow it is probably an indication of a problem that requires attention.
    4.  Tool/Report: Aging Work in Progress

Using the flow metrics in Scrum Events

| Metric | Sprint Planning | Daily Scrum | Retro | Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cycle Time |   |   | Also | Key |
| Throughput | Key |   | Key | Key |
| Current WIP |   | Key | Also | Key |
| Work Item Aging | Also | Key |   | Also |

[Limiting Work in Progress (WIP) in Scrum with Kanban - What? When? Who? How?](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/limiting-work-progress-wip-scrum-kanban-what-when-who-how)

1.  Limiting WIP actually aims to reduce and stabilize WIP in order to improve flow and provide predictability.
2.  Limiting WIP is probably even more important than visualizing flow (the board).
3.  The parties involved in the defined workflow would define WIP limits.
4.  Make WIP exceptions in extreme cases rather than change WIP limits.
5.  WIP limits shouldn't be changed on a whim. Create an exception and discussion rather than hide the problem under a policy change. WIP limits SHOULD be changed during the retro but CAN be changed anytime.
6.  WIP limiting can be done in several ways:
    1.  Limit the amount of work in progress per person
    2.  Per the entire team throughout their workflow
    3.  Limit WIP by time (sprint)

[Kanban Service Level Expectations and how to use them in Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/kanban-service-level-expectations-and-how-use-them-scrum)

1.  An SLE forecasts how long it should take a given item to flow from start to finish within your workflow. The SLE itself has two parts: a period of elapsed days and a probability associated with that period (e.g., "85% of work items will be finished in 8 days or less" which can also be stated as "8 days with 85% confidence/probability").
2.  We get the SLE from the cycle time scatterplot graph.
3.  Also, SLE's aren't SLA (Service Level Agreements). SLA is a loaded term that means different things in different contexts but generally is an external commitment about the service levels a team will provide. As mentioned an SLE is mainly internally focused.
4.  The term **expectation** is key here. We're not talking about commitments or promises. While it seems like an SLE is mainly serving the team's stakeholders its primary purpose is actually internally focused. The Development Team is using that expectation as a flow transparency, inspection, and adaptation mechanism. The team can start to actually compare active in-flight work to their SLE and look for items that are at risk of missing the SLE.

[How an expedite request sunk the Titanic by Daniel Vacanti](https://vimeo.com/239539858)

If you track nothing else, track cycle time for every work item (the date everything starts and the date it finishes).

Predicting when something will be done is determined by cycle time.

The first greatest influence on cycle time is WIP.

The second greatest influence on cycle time is pull policies.

Put cycle time in a histogram and notice the following. Affects of pull policies on cycle time:

| Pull Policy | Cycle Time |
| --- | --- |
| Strict FIFO (no expedites): | 50 days |
| Random queuing: | 60 days |
| Strict FIFO always one expedite: | 65 days |
| Random queuing always one expedite: | 100 days |

Think of your cycle time as a shape and not a number.

FIFO is almost impossible to implement as a pull policy so when you have to choose among multiple items to pull, you should choose the oldest one.

Tool/Report: Work in progress aging chart

Summary:

1.  Most of the unpredictability in your process is down to poor pull policies.
2.  In general, it is better to finish work already started before starting new work.
3.  Ask yourself: does the work I'm expediting really need to be expedited? Do I even have policies in place on how to decide what to expedite?

**Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)**

Diagram examples: https://imgur.com/a/TmwFvda

Band thickness and throughput

1.  Even means input/output are even and flow is good.
2.  If a band on your CFD is continuously narrowing that means that the throughput of the stage it represents is higher than the entry rate. This is a sign that you’ve got more capacity than you really need at this stage and you should relocate it in order to optimize the flow.
3.  Rapidly widening bands means the number of cards that enter the corresponding stage on the Kanban board is higher than the number of assignments that are leaving it. It is a common problem that is usually caused by multitasking and other waste activities that don’t generate value.

A CFD shows the cumulative arrivals to and departures from a process over time, and is one of the best tools to visualize flow. The cumulative flow diagram is one of the most advanced analytics for Lean project management.

*   It provides a concise visualization of the metrics of flow.
*   Shows you how stable your flow is and helps you understand where to focus in order to make your process more predictable.
*   Gives you quantitative and qualitative insight into both past and existing problems.
*   CFDs cannot be used for forecasting.
*   Show the exact WIP, not average, and not approximate.
*   To calculate the values necessary for SLEs, more granular data is needed; e.g., you can use a Cycle Time scatterplot.
*   They are for average Cycle Time of groups of items, not single items.
*   CFDs cannot be used for forecasting.

Shows:

*   Cumulative number of work items
*   Stages of the workflow
*   WIP
*   Approx. avg cycle time
*   Average throughput

A CFD can be used for calculating the following metrics:

2.  WIP, for a date, exact
3.  Cycle Time, for a date, approximate average
4.  These calculations are for groups of work items, not single items.

Work Item Aging is any type of chart that shows the age of all in-progress items (separately). Remember that age is a metric that is only applicable to in-progress items.

**Teaching Notes**

I. A Review of Scrum

> Scrum: A framework within which other techniques and methods can be practiced. Scrum is not a process, technique, or definitive method. It is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.

*   Three roles:  
    a. PO  
    b. Dev Team  
    c. SM
*   Five Events:  
    a. The Sprint  
    b. Sprint Planning  
    c. Daily Scrum  
    d. Sprint Review  
    e. Sprint Retro
*   Three Artifacts  
    a. Product Backlog  
    b. Sprint Backlog  
    c. Increment
*   The Rules  
    The rules of Scrum bind together the roles, events, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interactions between them.

II. Kanban

> Kanban: A strategy for oprimizing the flow of stakeholder value through a process that uses a visual, WIP limited, pull system.

The most central concept to Kanban is the "Workflow"

Q. What is the Kanban Guide's definition of "Workflow"?  
A. A shared understanding within the SCRUM Team of how work is defined (work items), the start state of the process, the active states for the work items and the finished state of the work items. Workflow can be thought of as the "Team's policy" for how to get work to "Done".

A work about policies: Policies are the "rules of the game" for the Scrum Team's “Workflow”. Small changes to those policies can have a material impact on how the Scrum Team performs overall.

The workflow must have 5 things:

1.  Defined start + finish points
2.  Definition of work items (units of customer value)
3.  Defined workflow states
4.  Pull policies
5.  WIP Limits

Q. What is "Flow" related to Kanban?  
A. It is the movement of customer value throughout the product development system.

III. The 4 Flow Metrics

1.  WIP
2.  Cycle time
3.  Work item age
4.  Throughput

IV. The Flow Formula

Avg cycle time = Avg WIP / Avg Throughput

V. The 4 Flow Practices

1.  Visualization of the workflow
2.  Limiting WIP
3.  Active management of work items
4.  Inspect and adapt the definition of workflow

VI. Flow Indicators

Leading:

WIP

Work item age

Lagging:

Cycle time

Throughput

Velocity (not a flow metric)

## Execution Plan

**Introduction to Flow Methods**  
Sprint Flow: Turning Swamps Into Rivers. This would be a talk introducing the ideas and reasoning behind them. It would explain interpreting the metrics and demonstrate the predictive power of them. No announcement of any new practices would be made.

**Introduce Flow Metrics in Scrum Events**

Sprint Planning: User Story (PBI) throughput

The Daily Scrum: The Scrum Guide suggests that the Development Team members explain what they did yesterday, what they are focusing on today, and what their impediments are. _Kanban teams typically focus on the flow of work instead of the people doing the work_. They work the board right to left focusing on flow problems. Introduce work item age chart.

Sprint Review: Say/Do of user stories.

Sprint Retro: Review all charts/metrics (our current retrospectives are not useful). This meeting is where changes should be made and stuck to for the durration of the sprint.

**Calculate and display SLEs**

**Introduce Board WIP Limits**
