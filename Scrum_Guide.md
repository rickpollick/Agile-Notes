The PDCA (Plan DO Check Act) cycle was made popular by Dr. W. Edwards Deming. This is a scientific cyclic process which can be used to improve the process (or product). This is cyclic in nature and usually time boxed.

• Plan – Sprint planning
• Do – Actual engineering sprint – deliver a potential shippable code
• Check – Sprint review
• Act – Retrospective
