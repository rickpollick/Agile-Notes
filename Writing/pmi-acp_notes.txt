## Four Values of Agile:
1. We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
2. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
3. Working software over comprehensive documentation
4. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
5. Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
