## Four Values of Agile:
 - We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
 - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
 - Working software over comprehensive documentation
 - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
 - Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
