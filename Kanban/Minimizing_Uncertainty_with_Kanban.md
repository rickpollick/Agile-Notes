# Minimizing Uncertainty with Kanban

This week the class is introduced to Kanban and its principles. The focus is on how to minimize uncertainty in work progress by using Kanban.

A Note on Uncertainty:

*   It's unavoidable (we can't predict the future with certainty)
*   Uncertainty IS opportunity in disguise ([See](https://www.diamond-consultants.com/look-beyond-uncertainty-to-see-opportunity/) and [lead](https://randyhnelson.com/are-you-leading-with-uncertainty-or-opportunity-thinking/) from the one)
*   Address it iteratively. See the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop)

### Personal Questions

> Tell us a little about your career and background. How did you become a Scrum Master?

Theology and analytic philosophy -> Web developer -> Founder -> Accidental Scrum Master

> How did your early career influence your management style and how you manage/coach scrum teams?

*   The universe is rational.
*   Software is amazing.
*   The future is going to blow our minds.

> What do you really love about your current role?

*   Get to be close to the code without being blinded by it
*   Get to work with amazing engineers

> What are your top challenges as a Scum Manager?

*   Coaching
*   Getting buy-in on trying new things

> The class series is for professionals who want to improve their project management skills. What are your thoughts around the Scrum Master vs Project Manager roles?

1.  Project Manager:
    1.  Products over projects
    2.  Skilled knowledge workers need to manage themselves
2.  Scrum Master:
    1.  It's all about the increment
    2.  I'm driving for "Agile Coach"

> Do you have any personal advice for the class on how you manage complexity on your projects?

1.  Release early and release often
2.  Limit WIP
    1.  Littles Law
    2.  Deep Work
3.  Work backward from the vertical slice
    1.  At the team level and capability level

### Kanban Questions

> How did you first get introduced to Kanban?

1.  Through Scrum (just thought it was Scrum without the sprint)
2.  Kanban for Scrum Teams

> How would you describe differences between Kanban vs Scrum?

1.  One is a container and there other is a strategy

> What did think when you first experienced Kanban with your teams?

1.  A costly mistake
    1.  No WIP limits (push system)
    2.  WIP overwhelmed the team and the board started to become meaningless (all priority/no priority)
2.  Implementation rollout is currently a work in progress
    1.  Talk coming up
    2.  Will begin reviewing kanban metrics in the standard scrum events

> What has been your experience using Kanban boards?

1.  Started with Trello
2.  Moved to Jira
3.  Absolutely essential. The alternative is:
    1.  Endless multiplication of "working" and status report meetings
    2.  Tyranny of the immediate

> Do you prefer physical boards to digital versions?

I prefer digital for the following reasons:

1.  Distributed teams
2.  Unix philosophy of access (you cant drill down into a physical board to get more information)
3.  Push notifications
4.  Data exhaust

But also advocate the following:

1.  Physical boards had qualities that should carry over (story size)
2.  Digital boards as information radiators

> What are the pros/cons of Kanban?

Pros:

1.  Is the only quantitatively driven strategy that can be applied daily
    1.  SLE (gives you a target for every work item)
    2.  WIP (A sure lever to turn)
    3.  Work Item Age
2.  Very Simple (The Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams is 9 pages!!)
    1.  Combine that with the scrum guide (19 pages)
    2.  Compared to the PMBOK 6th edition book (800 pages)
3.  Can see results in a single sprint (2 weeks)

Cons:

1.  More complex than it seems
2.  Its perception
    1.  Kanban is for manufacturing
    2.  Kanban is for support work
    3.  Kanban just means you'll get it when it's done

> Any tips or techniques you would like to share with the class?

1.  Don't despise the days of small beginnings. Kanban core principles:
    1.  Start with what you know
    2.  Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities, and titles
2.  Reimagine everything as an engineering endeavor
    1.  Software is eating the world (coffee mug firmware updates)
    2.  Software will eat our jobs unless we become experts with the tools
3.  Develop your system/brand
    1.  Mindset
    2.  Write (singularityhacker blog, guest blog posts, magazines, self-published micro books)
